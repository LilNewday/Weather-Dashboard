# Weather Dashboard

## Description

The goal was to create a simple 5 day weather forecast dashboard that could display temperature, humidity, wind, and of course the weather. This project feels like a nice personal approach to bringing the weather to the user that tracks any other location that they may seek to know about. I will say that this project experience was the hardest frontend assignment I've done simply because I was still wrapping my head around using server-side API usage, but I think I ended up getting a decent handle of it and I now truly have more of a respect for utilizing them.

## Table of Contents

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

This is the default home page:

First you enter in the city or location that you are looking for:

Then the weather for today and the 5 day forecast show up:

It will then add it to a "History" row where you can interact with a previous location to bring it up:
